        Birds are my favorite type of animal. They are so diverse and unique and
        strange that it seems impossible not to love them. They are also my
        favorite subject to draw. Feathers are a pain to draw because of all the
        details but in the end, birds are so aesthetically pleasing to me that I
        will spend hours drawing them. All birds seem so squishy and fluffy and
        cute, especially pecky-peckies (chickens) and nightmurder birds (owls).
        Next time I shall blog about my favorite birds.

        If you love birds as much as I do, look into some of the endangered bird
        species in your area. Even just giving them a little publicity can do
        some good. Look at what happened with sea turtles!
